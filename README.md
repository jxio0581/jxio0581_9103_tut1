# The exploration of flowing light effect
## PART1

I aim to incorporate a flowing light effect into my project. The final effect I want to achieve in the project is to have certain patterns on the image formed by numerous lines with smoothly transitioning colors, a glowing outer appearance, and colors that shift evenly over time. Additionally, I plan to add interactivity by making the lines flow in response to the mouse movement, as shown in Pic 1 and Pic 2. I believe this effect can bring a sense of modern technology, enhance the artwork's contemporary feel, and create a romantic and dreamy atmosphere.

## PART2

I found a piece of code that may help achieve the desired effect. Its functionality is as follows: when the mouse moves, a line with circular particles is drawn following the mouse path. The example uses two custom classes: one class stores information, while the other class manages an array of objects and renders the connecting lines. 

This code provides two key functionalities:

1. Rendering lines based on the mouse movement path.

2. Creating graphics with evenly transitioning colors based on the hue.

Overall, this coding technique offers basic functionalities and ideas for implementing the flowing light effect.
